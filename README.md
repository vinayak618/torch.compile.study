Experiments on Torch Compile 2.0

## Development Setup

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting, enforced via pre-commit hooks.

After cloning the repository, set up the pre-commit hooks:

1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Set up the git hook scripts: `pre-commit install`

Now, pre-commit will run automatically on `git commit`.
